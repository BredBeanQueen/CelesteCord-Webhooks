**Welcome to <#1253617607664336917>!**

If you want to make music for Celeste mods, the [Everest Wiki](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Adding-Custom-Audio>) has a page on getting started.

Advanced topics can also be found on the wiki, such as [Adding Cassette Music](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Advanced-Custom-Audio#adding-cassette-music>) and [Adding Music Progression](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Advanced-Custom-Audio#adding-progression-to-music>).

Video tutorials for working with FMOD are available from [Thegur90](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orPDzqDGlfE>) and [iamdadbod](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfTsBFaxz_M>).

Lena Raine has articles on how Celeste's OST was composed, covering [the synths used](<https://medium.com/@kuraine/a-little-bit-about-celestes-synths-and-some-bonus-piano-461f62605ea1>) and [her approach to percussion](<https://medium.com/@kuraine/a-bit-about-percussion-in-celeste-and-some-tangents-along-the-way-e8d3f3fb2272>).
